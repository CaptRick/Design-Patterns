# Null Object Design Pattern
The Null Object Design Pattern wraps up the null into its own object. Instead of having a null reference for some object, we wrap it into a NULL version of that object which will implement the same interface that of the object, i.e. same methods and properties.

The intent of a NULL OBJECT is to encapsulate the absence of an object by providing a substitutable alternative that offers suitable default do-nothing-behavior. In short, a design where “nothing will come of nothing”.
