# Design Patterns

As a good JavaScript developer, you strive to write clean, healthy, and maintainable code. While solving interesting and unique challenges, you may find yourself writing code that looks similar to solutions for entirely different problems you've encountered before. Without realizing it, you may have already used a design pattern.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation. They provide various ways to create objects while keeping the system flexible and reusable. Examples include:

- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Factory Method**
- **Singleton**

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn't need to. Examples include:

- **Adapter**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns deal with communication between objects. They define how objects interact and communicate with each other. Examples include:

- **Command**
- **Iterator**
- **Null Object**
- **Observer**
