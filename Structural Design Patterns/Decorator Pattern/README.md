# Decorator Pattern
Allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

1. An example of a decorator is security management where business objects are given additional access to privileged information depending on the privileges of the authenticated user. For example, an HR manager gets to work with an employee object that has appended (i.e. is decorated with) the employee's salary record so that salary information can be viewed.
